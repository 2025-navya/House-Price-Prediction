**House Price Prediction**
This project predicts house prices based on various features like location, size, number of rooms, etc., using machine learning algorithms.

**Project Description**
In this project, we predict the prices of houses based on features like:

- Number of rooms
- Location
- Size (in square feet)
- Year built
- Neighborhood characteristics

We use regression models to predict house prices and evaluate the models' accuracy using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.
